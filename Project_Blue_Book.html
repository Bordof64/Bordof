    <h2>Facts About Project Blue Book</h2>
    <p>üîç Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings from 1952 to 1969.</p>
    <p>üìÅ Over 12,000 UFO reports were collected, and most were explained as natural or man-made phenomena.</p>
    <p>üö´ The project officially ended in 1969, concluding that UFOs posed no national security threat.</p>
    <p>üëΩ Some cases remain unexplained, leading to ongoing public interest and conspiracy theories.</p>

        <h2>Captain Ruppelt Era</h2>
        <p>According to Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, by the end of 1951, several high-ranking, very influential USAF
          generals were so dissatisfied with the state of Air Force UFO investigations that they dismantled Project
          Grudge and replaced it with Project Blue Book in March 1952. One of these men was Gen. Charles P. Cabell.
          Another important change came when General William Garland joined Cabell's staff; Garland thought the UFO
          question deserved serious scrutiny because he had witnessed a UFO.</p>

        <p>The new name, Project Blue Book, was selected to refer to the blue booklets used for testing at some colleges
          and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were
          giving the new project; it felt as if the study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book
          was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the Aerial Phenomenon Branch.</p>

        <h1 class="h1_2">Captain Hardin era</h1>
        <p>In March 1954, Captain Charles Hardin was appointed the head of Blue Book; however, the 4602nd conducted most
          UFO investigations, and Hardin did not object. Ruppelt wrote that Hardin "thinks that anyone who is even
          interested [in UFOs] is crazy. They bore him."


          In 1955, the Air Force decided that the goal of Blue Book should not be to investigate UFO reports but to
          minimize the number of unidentified UFO reports. By late 1956, the number of unidentified sightings had
          dropped from the 20-25% of the Ruppelt era to less than 1%.</p>
        <h1 class="h1_2">Captain Gregory era</h1>
        <p>Captain George T. Gregory took over as Blue Book's director in 1956. Clark writes that Gregory led Blue Book
          "in an even firmer anti-UFO direction than the apathetic Hardin."[13] The 4602nd was dissolved, and the 1066th
          Air Intelligence Service Squadron was charged with UFO investigations.

        <img src="Project.jpg" alt="">

          In fact, there was actually little or no investigation of UFO reports; a revised AFR 200-2 issued during
          Gregory's tenure emphasized that unexplained UFO reports must be reduced to a minimum.

          One way that Gregory reduced the number of unexplained UFOs was by simple reclassification. "Possible cases"
          became "probable", and "probable" cases were upgraded to certainties. By this logic, a possible comet became a
          probable comet, while a probable comet was flatly declared to have been a misidentified comet. Similarly, if a
          witness reported an observation of an unusual balloon - like object, Blue Book usually classified it as a
          balloon, with no research and qualification. These procedures became standard for most of Blue Book's later
          investigations; see Hynek's comments below.</p>
        <h1 class="h1_2">Major Friend era</h1>
        <p>Lt. Col. Robert J. Friend was appointed the head of Blue Book in 1958. Friend made some attempts to reverse
          the direction Blue Book had taken since 1954. Clark writes that "Friend's efforts to upgrade the files and
          catalog sightings according to various observed statistics were frustrated by a lack of funding and
          assistance.

          Heartened by Friend's efforts, Hynek organized the first of several meetings between Blue Book staffers and
          ATIC personnel in 1959. Hynek suggested that some older UFO reports should be reevaluated, with the ostensible
          aim of moving them from the "unknown" to the "identified" category. Hynek's plans came to naught.

          During Friend's tenure, ATIC contemplated passing the oversight of Blue Book to another Air Force agency, but
          neither the Air Research and Development Center nor the Office of Information for the Secretary of the Air
          Force was interested.

          In 1960, there were U.S. Congressional hearings regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group National
          Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) had publicly charged Blue Book with covering up UFO
          evidence and had also acquired a few allies in the U.S. Congress. Blue Book was investigated by the Congress
          and the CIA, with critics ‚Äî most notably, the civilian UFO group NICAP[12] asserting that Blue Book was
          lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three
          military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased Blue Book's budget. This seemed to mollify some
          of Blue Book's critics,[12] but it was only temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism would be
          even louder.

          By the time he was transferred from Blue Book in 1963, Friend thought that Blue Book was effectively useless
          and ought to be dissolved, even if it caused an outcry amongst the public</p>

          By the time he was transferred from Blue Book in 1963, Friend thought that Blue Book was effectively useless
          and ought to be dissolved, even if it caused an outcry amongst the public.[citation needed]

          Major Quintanilla era
          Major Hector Quintanilla took over as Blue Book's leader in August 1963. He largely continued the debunking
          efforts, and it was under his direction that Blue Book received some of its sharpest criticism. UFO researcher
          Jerome Clark goes so far as to write that, by this time, Blue Book had "lost all credibility."[14]

          Physicist and UFO researcher James E. McDonald once flatly declared that Quintanilla was "not competent" from
          either a scientific or an investigative perspective,[15] although he also stressed that Quintanilla "shouldn't
          be held accountable for it," as he was chosen for his position by a superior officer, and was following orders
          in directing Blue Book.[15]

          Blue Book's explanations of UFO reports were not universally accepted, however, and critics ‚Äî including some
          scientists ‚Äî suggested that Project Blue Book performed questionable research or, worse, was perpetrating
          cover-up.[12] This criticism grew especially strong and widespread in the 1960s.

          Take, for example, the many mostly nighttime UFO reports from the midwestern and southeastern United States in
          the summer of 1965: Witnesses in Texas reported "multicolored lights" and large aerial objects shaped like
          eggs or diamonds.[12] The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that Tinker Air Force Base (near Oklahoma City) had
          tracked up to four UFOs simultaneously, and that several of them had descended very rapidly: from about 22000
          feet to about 4000 feet in just a few seconds,[12] an action well beyond the capabilities of conventional
          aircraft of the era. John Shockley, a meteorologist from Wichita, Kansas, reported that, using the state
          Weather Bureau radar, he tracked a number of odd aerial objects flying at altitudes between about 6000 and
          9000 feet.[12] These and other reports received wide publicity.

          Project Blue Book officially determined[12] the witnesses had mistaken Jupiter or bright stars (such as Rigel
          or Betelgeuse) for something else.

          Blue Book's explanation was widely criticized as inaccurate. Robert Riser, director of the Oklahoma Science
          and Art Foundation Planetarium offered a strongly worded rebuke of Project Blue Book that was widely
          circulated: "That is as far from the truth as you can get. These stars and planets are on the opposite side of
          the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year. The Air Force must have had its star finder upside-down
          during August".[12]

          A newspaper editorial from the Richmond News Leader opined that "Attempts to dismiss the reported sightings
          under the rationale as exhibited by Project Bluebook [sic] won't solve the mystery ... and serve only to
          heighten the suspicion that there's something out there that the air force doesn't want us to know about",[12]
          while a Wichita-based UPI reporter noted that "Ordinary radar does not pick up planets and stars".[12]

          Another case that Blue Book's critics seized upon was the so-called Portage County UFO Chase, which began at
          about 5 a.m., near Ravenna, Ohio on April 17, 1966. Police officers Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff spotted what
          they described as a disc-shaped, silvery object with a bright light emanating from its underside, at about
          1000 feet in altitude.[12] They began following the object (which they reported sometimes descended as low as
          50 feet), and police from several other jurisdictions were involved in the pursuit. The chase ended about 30
          minutes later near Freedom, Pennsylvania, some 85 miles away.

          The UFO chase made national news, and the police submitted detailed reports to Blue Book. Five days later,
          following brief interviews with only one of the police officers (but none of the other ground witnesses), Blue
          Book's director, Major Hector Quintanilla, announced their conclusions: The police (one of them an Air Force
          gunner during the Korean War) had first chased a communications satellite, then the planet Venus.

          This conclusion was widely derided,[12] and police officers strenuously rejected it. In his dissenting
          conclusion, Hynek described Blue Book's conclusions as absurd: in their reports, several of the police had
          unknowingly described the Moon, Venus and the UFO, though they unknowingly described Venus as a bright "star"
          very near the Moon. Ohio Congressman William Stanton said that "The Air Force has suffered a great loss of
          prestige in this community ... Once people entrusted with the public welfare no longer think the people can
          handle the truth, then the people, in return, will no longer trust the government".

          In September 1968, Hynek received a letter from Colonel Raymond Sleeper of the Foreign Technology Division.
          Sleeper noted that Hynek had publicly accused Blue Book of shoddy science, and further asked Hynek to offer
          advice on how Blue Book could improve its scientific methods. Hynek was to later declare that Sleeper's letter
          was "the first time in my 20 year association with the air force as scientific consultant that I had been
          officially asked for criticism and advice [regarding] ... the UFO problem".[16]

          Hynek wrote a detailed response, dated October 7, 1968, suggesting several areas where Blue Book could
          improve. In part, he wrote:

          ... neither of the two missions of Blue Book [determining if UFOs are a threat to national security and using
          scientific data gathered by Blue Book] are being adequately executed.
          The staff of Blue Book, both in numbers and in scientific training, is grossly inadequate ...
          Blue Book suffers ... in that it is a closed system ... there is virtually no scientific dialogue between Blue
          Book and the outside scientific world ...
          The statistical methods employed by Blue Book are nothing less than a travesty.
          There has been a lack of attention to significant UFO cases ... and too much time spent on routine cases ...
          and on peripheral public relations tasks. Concentration could be on two or three potentially scientific
          significant cases per month [instead of being] spread thin over 40 to 70 cases per month.
          The information input to Blue Book is grossly inadequate. An impossible load is placed on Blue Book by the
          almost consistent failure of UFO officers at local air bases to transmit adequate information ...
          The basic attitude and approach within Blue Book is illogical and unscientific ...
          Inadequate use had been made of the Project scientific consultant [Hynek]. Only cases that the project monitor
          deems worthwhile are brought to his attention. His scope of operation ... has been consistently thwarted ...
          He often learns of interesting cases only a month or two after the receipt of the report at Blue Book.[17]
          Despite Sleeper's request for criticism, none of Hynek's commentary resulted in any substantial changes in
          Blue Book.

          Quintanilla's own perspective on the project is documented in his manuscript, "UFOs, An Air Force Dilemma."
          Lt. Col Quintanilla wrote the manuscript in 1975, but it was not published until after his death in 1998.
          Quintanilla stated in the text that he personally believed it arrogant to think human beings were the only
          intelligent life in the universe. Yet, while he found it highly likely that intelligent life existed beyond
          Earth, he had no hard evidence of any extraterrestrial visitation</p>
        <h1 class="h1_2">Congressional hearing</h1>
        <p>In 1966, a string of UFO sightings in Massachusetts and New Hampshire provoked a Congressional Hearing by the
          House Committee on Armed Services.[19] According to attachments to the hearing, the Air Force had at first
          stated that the sightings were the result of a training exercise happening in the area.[20] But NICAP, the
          National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, reported that there was no record of a plane flying at
          the time the sightings occurred.[21] Another report alleged that the UFO was actually a flying billboard
          advertising gasoline.[22] Raymond Fowler (of NICAP) added his own interviews with the locals, who saw Air
          Force officers confiscating newspapers with the story of UFOs and telling them not to report what they had
          seen.[23] Two police officers who had witnessed the UFOs, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, wrote a letter to
          Major Quintanilla stating that they felt their reputations were destroyed by the Air Force. "It was impossible
          to mistake what we saw for any kind of military operation, regardless of altitude," the irritated officers

          </div>

          wrote, adding that there was no way it could have been a balloon or helicopter.[24] According to Secretary
          Harold Brown of the Air Force, Blue Book consisted of three steps: investigation, analysis, and the
          distribution of information gathered to interested parties.[25] After Brown gave permission, the press were
          invited into the hearing.[26] By the time of the hearing, Blue Book had identified and explained 95% of the
          reported UFO sightings. None of these were extraterrestrial or a threat to national security.[27] Brown
          himself proclaimed, "I know of no one of scientific standing or executive standing with a detailed knowledge
          of this, in our organization who believes that they came from extraterrestrial sources."[27] J. Allen Hynek, a
          science consultant to Blue Book, suggested in an unedited statement that a "civilian panel of physical and
          social scientists" be formed "for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem really exist" in
          regards to UFOs.[28] Hynek remarked that he has "not seen any evidence to confirm" extraterrestrials, "nor do
          I know any competent scientist who has, or who believes that any kind of extraterrestrial intelligence is
          involved."</p>
        <h1 class="h1_2">Condon Committee</h1>
        <p>Main article: Condon Committee
          Criticism of Blue Book continued to grow through the mid-1960s. NICAP's membership ballooned to about 15,000,
          and the group charged the U.S. Government with a cover-up of UFO evidence.

          Following U.S. Congressional hearings, the Condon Committee was established in 1966, ostensibly as a neutral
          scientific research body. However, the Committee became mired in controversy, with some members charging
          director Edward U. Condon with bias, and critics would question the validity and the scientific rigor of the
          Condon Report.

          In the end, the Condon Committee suggested that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs, and while it left
          a minority of cases unexplained, the report also argued that further research would not be likely to yield
          significant results.</p>
        <h1 class="h1_2">End</h1>
        <p>In response to the Condon Committee's conclusions, Secretary of the Air Force Robert C. Seamans, Jr.
          announced that Blue Book would soon be closed because further funding "cannot be justified either on the
          grounds of national security or in the interest of science."[30] The last publicly acknowledged day of Blue
          Book operations was December 17, 1969. However, researcher Brad Sparks,[31] citing research from the May 1970
          issue of NICAP's UFO Investigator, reports that the last day of Blue Book activity was actually January 30,
          1970. According to Sparks, Air Force officials wanted to keep the Air Force's reaction to the UFO problem from
          overlapping into a fourth decade, and thus altered the date of Blue Book's closure in official files.

          Blue Book's files were sent to the Air Force Archives at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Major David Shea
          was to later claim that Maxwell was chosen because it was "accessible yet not too inviting."[30]

          Ultimately, Project Blue Book stated that UFOs sightings were generated as a result of:

          <li>A mild form of mass hysteria.</li>
          <li>Individuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or seek publicity.</li>
          <li>Psychopathological persons.</li>
          <li>Misidentification of various conventional objects.</li>
          <br>
          In April 2003, the USAF publicly indicated that there were no immediate plans to re-establish any official
          government UFO study programs.[32] However, in December 2017 it was disclosed that a new secret UFO study
          titled the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) was funded at 22 million dollars from 2007
          to 2012</p>
